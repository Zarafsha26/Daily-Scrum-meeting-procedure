# Daily-Scrum-meeting-procedure

# Timing and Duration:
- Typically held every day.
- Strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes.
- It's essential to start on time even if some team members are late.
  
# Location:
- While traditionally held face-to-face, many teams now use video calls or other virtual meeting tools, especially with the rise of remote work.
  
# Participants:
- Development Team members are the primary participants.
- The Scrum Master ensures the meeting takes place but doesn't have to attend unless needed.
- The Product Owner can attend but is not required to.
- Other stakeholders (like managers, other teams, etc.) might attend but do not participate. They're just observers.
  
# Primary Questions:
- Team members typically address three main questions:
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do I see any impediments that could prevent me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
  
# Procedure:
- One by one, each team member speaks. There is no set order, but some teams might use a token or object to indicate who has the floor.
- The discussion is focused, concise, and relevant.
- It's not a status meeting for a manager; it's a synchronization and planning meeting for the team.
  
# Impediments:
- If a team member identifies an impediment, the Scrum Master's role is to help remove it.
- Detailed discussions about solving impediments are taken offline and not during the Daily Scrum.
- 
# Role of the Scrum Master:
- Ensures the Daily Scrum happens.
- Teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.
- Facilitates or leads only if necessary and requested by the team.
- Ensures that participants respect the rules and format of the Daily Scrum.
 
# Follow-up:
- If there are discussions or topics that arise and need deeper exploration, they should be taken "offline" (i.e., discussed after the Daily Scrum).
  
# Outcomes:
- A clear understanding of the progress towards the Sprint Goal.
- Identified impediments or challenges that need to be addressed.
- A plan for the next 24 hours.
  
# Tips for Effectiveness:
- Ensure everyone is engaged.
- Keep it brisk and to the point. It's a check-in, not a detailed discussion.
- Visual aids like task boards or digital tools can help in visualizing the team's progress.
- Use it as a moment to re-energize and refocus, not just report.
-Remember, the key to a successful Daily Scrum is to keep it consistent, focused, and brief, ensuring that the team remains synchronized and clear about their goals and challenges.
